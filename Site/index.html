				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>
				<img src="misc/javier.png" alt="Javier Taylor" width="200" style="border: 5px solid black">
					<h3><b id="link">Who am I?</b></h3>My name is Javier Taylor and I am a 19 year old aspiring software engineer studying Computer Science in my soon to be third year
					at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, MI. I grew up in Ypsilanti, MI, and my roots lie in the hills of Tennesse and in the Dominican Republic.
					<h3><b id="link">How did I get here?</b></h3>Before coming to college I had never written a line of code in my life. I chose the University of Michigan because it was
					close, I loved the sports teams, and I thought I was going to be a mechanical engineer. But, when I took my first programming course, I realized that I had found something
					that I really enjoyed, so I threw myself in to it. I started going deeper in to the major, working in class and on my own to hone my programming abilities. I have worked
					to develop teamwork and leadership through group projects and organizations that I am a part of, and it has shaped the way that I look at development. I have taken 
					courses ranging from entrepreneurial creativity to data structures and algorithms, and the more that I learn, the better I am at working through any problem that is thrown my way. I am currently a Software Engineering intern at Servant Systems Inc, a small company near Ann Arbor, MI.  
					<h3><b id="link">What do I love to do?</b></h3>I expect to graduate in April/May of 2018.
	I am interested in software engineering and entrepreneurship and their application to real world problems that lead to innovative solutions. I am keen on collaborative software development, and through coursework and extracurricular experience have gained the knowledge to design and implement clean, efficient, and robust code. I have extensive experience with leadership and teamwork, and recognize its importance to the software development process. Before college I had never written a single line of code, but I have since delved in to a passion for programming, and have pursued excellence in it ever since. I am passionate about entrepreneurship and the benefits that an entrepreneurial mindset can bring to a company of any size through the culture of innovation and passion that are associated with it.I am currently a rising third year student studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan through the College of Engineering with a minor in Entrepreneurship.
