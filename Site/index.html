				<h3><b id="link">What do I love to do?</b></h3>My name is Javier Taylor and am a 19 year old aspiring software engineer sophomore studying Computer Science at the University 
					of Michigan in Ann Arbor, MI. I am originally from Ypsilanti, MI.
					I am currently a rising third year student studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan through the College of Engineering with a minor in Entrepreneurship. I expect to graduate in April/May of 2018.
I am interested in software engineering and entrepreneurship and their application to real world problems that lead to innovative solutions. I am keen on collaborative software development, and through coursework and extracurricular experience have gained the knowledge to design and implement clean, efficient, and robust code. I have extensive experience with leadership and teamwork, and recognize its importance to the software development process. Before college I had never written a single line of code, but I have since delved in to a passion for programming, and have pursued excellence in it ever since. I am passionate about entrepreneurship and the benefits that an entrepreneurial mindset can bring to a company of any size through the culture of innovation and passion that are associated with it.I am currently a rising third year student studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan through the College of Engineering with a minor in Entrepreneurship.
