				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>
				<img src="misc/javier.png" alt="Javier Taylor" width="200" style="border: 5px solid black">
					<h3><b id="link">Who am I?</b></h3>My name is Javier Taylor and I am a 19 year old aspiring software engineer studying Computer Science in my soon to be third 
					year at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, MI. I grew up in Ypsilanti, MI, and my roots lie in the hills of Tennesse and in the Dominican Republic.
					<h3><b id="link">How did I get here?</b></h3>Before coming to college I had never written a line of code in my life. I chose the University of Michigan 
					because it was close, I loved the sports teams, and I thought I was going to be a mechanical engineer. But, when I took my first programming course, I 
					realized that I had found something that I really enjoyed, so I threw myself in to it. I started going deeper in to the major, working in class and on my own 
					to hone my programming abilities. I have worked to develop teamwork and leadership through group projects and organizations that I am a part of, and it has 
					shaped the way that I look at development. I have taken courses ranging from entrepreneurial creativity to data structures and algorithms, and the more that I 
					learn, the better I am at working through any problem that is thrown my way. I am currently a Software Engineering intern at Servant Systems Inc, a small company
					near Ann Arbor, MI.  
					<h3><b id="link">What should you know about me?</b></h3>I love to program. I hope that will become obvious to you when you look at all that I have to show you. 
					But, I will not pretend that is the only thing that I love to do, as that would be unfortunate. I love to travel, explore, and hang out with friends, preferably 
					all together. I have been to many parts of the US, though some of my favorite places to go are on the sand dunes and shores of the Great Lakes. I love to sail, 
					to read, to eat good food, and to play video games. I am passionate about my Christian faith, and I am deeply involved in it and in representing its ideals to 
					the world. I love cars, camping, and physical activity, such as playing football, soccer, basketball, or rugby, or lifting weights and exercising. I strive
					to work hard and be honest in all that I do, and to serve others with my actions and relations. 
					<h3><b id="link">Why are you here?</b></h3>Clearly, I do not know why you are here. Maybe you are a recruiter, maybe you are a friend, maybe you saw my GitHub
					and followed a link, or maybe you just randomly found my website while surfing the Web. Whatever it is, I would just like to show you a little bit about myself. There are links at the top to different sections, so just scroll around and see if there is anything you like. Enjoy!

						I have bled Maize and Blue for most of my life, and I am proud to have the opportunity to go to the University of Michigan. As a student in the 
						College of Engineering at Michigan, I have written my first line of code, learned about programming from the assembly level to the user interface,
						and continue to learn what it takes to be a good programmer. On top of that I have learned how to work on a team, lead multidisciplinary groups
						to acheive our goals, and how to communicate effectively, along with much more. I am still a work in progress, but I'm moving along quickly!
